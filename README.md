### Project Description:

This is an unchanged version of our semester long project we did for CIS 3760. The project is a web application that uses sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of a given topic on social media. The topic we chose to analyze was Universal Basic Income. The application uses a Python backend to scrape social media sites for posts related to the topic, and then uses a sentiment analysis library to determine the sentiment of each post. The sentiment of each post is then stored in a database, and the frontend displays the overall sentiment of the topic as a whole. The frontend also displays the sentiment of each individual post.

### Project Wiki:

This is the [Wiki](ubi.wiki/Table-of-Contents/Home.md) imported from GitLab. It contains all of the documentation for the project.

### How to run the application:

The application should be able to run locally using Docker, but I haven't tested it yet since for the final project we deployed it to the school server. If there are any issues running it locally, please let me know and I will try to fix it when I have time.
