### Project Description:

This is the semester-long project we did for CIS 3760 with any secret keys removed for security reasons. The project is a web application that uses sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of a given topic on social media. The topic we chose to analyze was Universal Basic Income. The application uses a Python backend to scrape social media sites for posts related to the topic and then uses a sentiment analysis library to determine the sentiment of each post. The sentiment of each post is then stored in a database, and the front end displays the overall sentiment of the topic as a whole. The front end also displays the sentiment of each post.

### Project Wiki:

This is the [Wiki](ubi.wiki/Table-of-Contents/Home.md) imported from GitLab. It contains all of the documentation for the project.

### How to run the application:

The application should be able to run locally using Docker, but I haven't tested it yet since for the final project we deployed it to the school server. If there are any issues running it locally, it is most likely because I had to remove some secrets that did not belong to me.
