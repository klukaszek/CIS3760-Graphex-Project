Universal basic income or UBI, is a form of social welfare, where people receive supplementary income from the state. It is a relatively hot topic politically, especially interesting now and can be found in the crossroads of increasing automation and the ever rising cost of living.

Our project aims to visualize data found on social media surrounding this term.

The visualizations we plan to implement:
- Amount of data collected.
- Random post view.
- Interactive word cloud.
- Key word bar graph.
- Possibly more in the future.
