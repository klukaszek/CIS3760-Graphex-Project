### 1) Specify the type of commit <br>
- feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application <br>
- fix: A bug fix<br>
- style: Feature and updates related to styling<br>
- refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase<br>
- test: Everything related to testing<br>
- docs: Everything related to documentation<br>
- chore: Regular code maintenance.[ You can also use emojis to represent commit types]<br>

### 2) Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph

### 3) Do not end the subject line with a period

### 4) Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Imperative mood just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”. A few examples:

- Clean your room
- Close the door
- Take out the trash

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:<br> 
If applied, this commit will _your subject line here_

For example:

- If applied, this commit will _refactor subsystem X for readability_
- If applied, this commit will _update getting started documentation_
- If applied, this commit will _remove deprecated methods_
