##  App Characteristics
​
- **links to the issues describing the two new user stories**
	-
- **instructions for viewing and interacting with those user stories using the staging server**
	- 
- **links to descriptions for any other user stories implemented**
	- 
- **link to explanation of how the data is integrated for one of the visualizations.  Include evidence that two different APIs are for data gathering.** 
	- 
- **link to evidence that  web app is updating data on some sort of schedule and that the database is not dumping data every time new data is fetched.**

​
## Tech Requirements
- **Evidence that testing automated in in CI including:**
    - **back end  unit testing fulling automated using a database mock**
       - 
    - **test coverage report shows more than 70% coverage**
    	-	   
    - **front end unit testing  automated using a back end mock**
    	- 
    - **test coverage at least 25%**
    	- 
- **Evidence that User interface testing repeatable**
	- 
- **Evidence of automatable integration testing**
	- 
- **Evidence that data is be cached in a database**
	- 
    -  **some evidence of data processing prior to caching**
    	-  
    - **database schema must be explicitly defined in wiki**
   	 - 
- **Evidence that app deploys automatically to staging  using CD when pushed to staging branch**
    - 
- **Evidence that code  base is clean and refactored**
	-

## Scrum Process
- **Sprint Goal and team roles**
	- 	
- **Evidence of Scrum process**
    - **meetings (planning, daily scrum, sprint review)**
    	- 
    - **evidence that vertical slices are completed rather than three separate services developed independently**
    	- 
    - **evidence of code reviews that do more than just merge without any discussion**
    	- 
    - **evidence of team coding standards and record keeping processes that include some process to standardize descriptions of user stories and tickets (e.g. templates)**
    	- 
    - **evidence that the scrum board is used and that all team members participate **
    	- 
    - **user stories decomposed into tasks with documentation about which tasks belong to which user stories**
    	- 
    - **definition of done includes acceptance criteria for user stories but is not limited to acceptance criteria.  Must be explicitly stated on each user story.  A template in the wiki is insufficient.**
