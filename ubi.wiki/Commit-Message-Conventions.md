## Use the imperative mood in the subject line <br>
Imperative mood just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”.  <br>
A few examples: <br>

Clean your room <br>
Close the door <br>
Take out the trash <br>

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:  <br>
_If applied, this commit will "your subject line here"_  <br>
For example: <br>
 _If applied, this commit will "refactor subsystem X for readability"_

## Specify the type of commit: <br>
feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application <br>
fix: A bug fix <br>
style: Feature and updates related to styling <br>
refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase <br>
test: Everything related to testing <br>
docs: Everything related to documentation <br>
chore: Regular code maintenance. <br>

## Do not end the subject line with a period

## Capitalize the subject line
